The truth is probably as vague as: it depends on your needs and use of the functions that TypeScript offers. Anyway, here are some of our reasons behind why we think that the use of TypeScript may have some advantages. </p>\n<!-- First of all, probably the most noticeable feature with TypeScript is that it offers **type checking and static code analysis**. The ability to require values to be of a certain type and to have the compiler warn about wrongful usage can help reduce runtime errors and you might even be able to reduce the amount of required unit tests in a project, at least concerning pure type tests. The static code analysis doesn't only warn about wrongful type usage, but also if you for instance misspell a variable or function name or try to use a value beyond it's scope etc. With the help of a sufficient linter settings, it's hard to even think of runtime errors that you may be able to produce. -->\n<p>First of all, TypeScript offers <i>type checking and static code analysis</i>. We can require values to be of a certain type, and have the compiler warn about using them wrong. This can reduce runtime errors and you might even be able to reduce the amount of required unit tests in a project, at least concerning pure type tests.\nThe static code analysis doesn't only warn about wrongful type usage, but also other mistakes such as misspelling a variable or function name or trying to use a variable beyond its scope. </p>\n<!-- A second advantage with TypeScript is that the type annotations in the code can function as a type of **code level documentation**. It's easy to check from a function signature what kind of arguments the function can receive and what type of data it will return. This type of type annotation bound documentation will always be up to date and it makes it easier for new programmers to start working on an existing project. It is also helpful when returning to an old project. Types may also be re-used all around the code base, so a change to one type automatically reflects as a change to all the locations where the type is used. One might argue that you can achieve similar code level documentation with e.g. [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html), but it is not connected to the code as tightly as TypeScript's types, and may thus get out of sync more easily and is also more verbose. -->\n<p>The second advantage of TypeScript is that the type annotations in the code can function as a type of <i>code level documentation</i>.\nIt's easy to check from a function signature what kind of arguments the function can consume and what type of data it will return.

The reason behind this is most often that the library has not been made with TypeScript. Then the types need to be declared manually, or if someone has already done that they might not have done such a good job with it. These are occasions when you may need to define type declarations yourself. However, you should first check out [DefinitelyTyped](https://definitelytyped.org/) or [their GitHub pages](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped), which are probably the most used sources for type declaration files and there is a good chance someone has already added typings for the package you are using.
